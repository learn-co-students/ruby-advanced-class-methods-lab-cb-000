note on what not to do (new_from_filename method):
* song_title = song_details[1].split(".mp3") returns an array:
  expected: "For Love I Come"
  got: ["For Love I Come"]

* song_title = song_details[1].delete(".mp3") removes all matching letters:
  expected: "Blank Space"
  got: "Blank Sace"

what works instead:
* song_title = song_details[1].split(".mp3").join("") turns array into string --> OK
  expected: "Blank Space"
  got: "Blank Space"

* song_title = song_details[1].gsub(".mp3", "") replaces the string '.mp3' with '' (https://apidock.com/ruby/String/gsub)
  expected: "Blank Space"
  got: "Blank Space"
